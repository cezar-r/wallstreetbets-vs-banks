They *both* will squeeze. This isn\u2019t a dick measuring contest.

It\u2019s not, but like I said, round numbers. \n\n$1000 = 4 shares of GME or 21 shares of AMC. In order to reach 1 million, GME needs to hit a minimum of $250k. Meanwhile AMC would only need to hit $47.6k. So while it still needs to be proven that the \u201cmagnitude\u201d of the squeeze on GME will be greater, if my only goal is to make $1million my road to that victory is achieved far earlier with amc.

I hope GME goes to $36 million per share or whatever stupid fucking number it is now, because *it needs to* as many of the new apes holding GME are only holding X or *maybe* XX shares.

It's a bet the market will catch up to where it's publicly forecast to be.

AMC has a short utilization rate around 99%, a cost to borrow of 10%, and a larger open interest position than actual shares. It's not crazy to try to get a piece of it (and the CEO/Board are particularly brilliant for capitalizing on this by selling shares to get cash for the company, bravo!). MVIS and GME aren't as tightly bound up, but they're hardly in normal parameters. BB isn't really in those squeezes yet, but it's a plausible target.\n\nI have no illusions that WSB is doing this themselves.

All we can do when we are trained in finance is use our best judgment based on historical examples to give an educated guess at what those variable values may be. In my first example I used what happened historically to show how AMC may react to a squeeze based on how another company's stocks did (GME). Several people pointed out however that the markets were flawed in that squeeze due to throttled upside by large financial institutions to slow thier losses. Whether that was intentional or not, i do believe it did in fact happen to slow the rise of GME. VW on the other hand was able to skyrocket in 2008 with no resistance so it only seemed fair to use those variables to calculate the rise for AMC. What I can say is that there are still variables Un accounted for. The most important probably being the %of short float. Another is the overall size different of the market as a whole from 2008 until now. I will humbly say that basically if the math proves to be wrong it is simply because there is no equation that I am capable of putting together that wouldn't take a professor of calculus to solve.

Consoles are in high demand with lower price points on digital consoles. Consoles that render the purchase of physical games useless. Retail requires high overhead costs especially with labor and logistics. Not to mention we now live in a society where being a hermit and instant gratification is the norm (in this country anyway), at least within certain demographics. Unless they change their game (fun with pun) GME is bleeding out bad.\n\nAMC - Also a high overhead company with a need for physical locations and labor forces. They are playing in a market with growing digital dominance. Over the past year new movie releases are playing at home rather than a theater near you. Although there is a still a high desire to get out and do things in certain demographics the battle for AMC will be extremely challenging.\n\nDigital &gt; Physical - Digital offers much higher profit margins in today's connected world. Overhead costs are extremely low. Why would you, as a company, choose to spend millions on labor, logistics, production, manufacturing when you can sell the same product at the same price points with a far greater profit margin?

The only reason to use a more sophisticated algorithm is to improve accuracy, but there are two fundamental problems with the proposed solution. One is inherent to the hypothesis that sentiment is a proxy for price action. I believe that was true, that's why I built an algorithm. This turns out to be partially true. The basic correlation analysis (Kendall's Tau) revealed that the ticker mentions correlate to the volume, however volume does not correlate to the positive price action. The second problem is the time scale of the algorithm. Because of my day job I cannot do intra-day trading, so I choose daily predictions. Unfortunately, the algorithm becomes almost descriptive (reactionary) than predictive. Yes you can find all the great stocks a day later, but that doesn't help since MM already starts their counter move the next day. There's probably a third and more nuanced issue, which is related to natural language processing. When someone mentions a ticker, say GME,  in a positive way, it follows with lots rocket emojis and \"i love the stonk\" or \"that is the way\". Your algorithm needs to be sophisticated enough to understand stonk==GME. That's why you need transformers with a sufficient beam length (sorry for the technical jargon).

Firstly, Gamestops prices are much more competitive than Amazon and they offer same day delivery. Some games are going for less than half of what Amazon offers. Second, unlike Amazon, GME is commited to gaming and are the only major player doing this so they can offer bundles and benefits that Amazon will never be able to compete with aside from esports at their thousands of locations. Third, they sell games for all console so don't understand what you mean by mid gen, and they sell computers hardware and accessories so you can build your own beast or they can for you at no extra charge. Fourthly, aside from GME being the only real player in a multibillion dollar industry with massive growth potential being led by someone who we trust knows what he's doing because of his track record which is much more reliable than your opinion of GME, the stock is disproportionately shorted.

GME squeeze wasn\u2019t possible even 5-10 years ago as people weren\u2019t all over on Reddit, Twitter, etc.)\n\n2) silver production is largely a byproduct of other resource mining at this point, mostly due to the low price but also due to the fact that it\u2019s a fringe ore that is usually found peripherally to other metals like gold, iron, aluminum, etc.\n\nTherefore, when price skyrockets and/or demand skyrockets it\u2019s not as simple as just \u201copening new mines\u201d. There is a significant delay between exploration and development before production/release of silver. The production has recently started tapering in recent months/years as the lag between no new mines being opened in the past years and the supply effects catches up. \n\nIn the coming years, due to inelastic industrial demand, skyrocketing inflation, and increased retail investment demand, I believe the banks paper silver game will finally be exposed (they don\u2019t have the physical silver they pretend to, and they\u2019re deathly afraid of getting caught with their pants down) and there will be a significant lag before silver production is able to be meaningfully increased...\n\nSilver = \ud83c\udf19\n\nWhile PSLV and physical silver is the backbone of this movement, if you\u2019re an ape that demands a riskier move in return for a possibly higher reward...\n\nAG, SILJ, other silver miner stocks are all good...\n\nAs are options in those stocks for the highest risk/highest reward plays.", "Biggest bear trap of the year so far.\n\nWatch some big gains coming tomorrow. \n\nASO and GME both coiled and primed for liftoff.", "Gme is garbage", "Funny... gme is still holding up relative to the rest of the market.\n\nHmmmm", "Rookie numbers kid, GME is a 10,000 bagger.", "Exactly - the idea is that the entity on the hook if your bet goes bad is monitoring your ability to pay it back... and if they conclude that you've reach a limit, they will margin call you - at which point you typically have a limited period of time during which to either pay back and get out of debt or raise more capital to cover the debt (if, for example, you're just sure it will come back up).\n\nIn the current hubbub with GME, if Citadel gets margin called, they have billions upon billions of assets, but a new rule went into effect (or is on the verge of being put into effect) that means if they are margin called, they have all of 1 hour to find more capital... after which their overseeing entity could step in and just begin liquidating (selling) everything they have in order to buy back shorted GameStop shares.
