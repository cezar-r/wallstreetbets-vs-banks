But there can be a place for WSB in a reasonable portfolio, because WSB is a data point for retail investor sentiment, and because there's now a feedback loop between WSB and hedge funds. Around 5% of my portfolio is informed, in part, by WSB. \n\nFor example, at the moment some of the WSB stonks are AMC, BB, MVIS, GME, CLNE, and NOK.\n\nNOK is the funniest one: it's a genuinely undervalued stock. Use any metric you like (P/E, EV/EBITDA, FCF Yield, ROIC/WACC) and the company is trading at a bargain. There are a lot of good reasons to believe Wall Street's analysts are behind the ball on this one. Pretty normal type of trade, TBH, and if it's got momentum, awesome.\n\nCLNE is the opposite: bad numbers IMHO, but the few Wall Street analysts covering it think it should trade for double its value. It's a bet the market will catch up to where it's publicly forecast to be. Also a normal type of trade. \n\nAMC, GME, and MVIS are more classically WSB stocks: absolute garbage fires, companies that were such obvious losers with no hope of a future that a lot of Wall Street banks and hedge funds got lazy and careless and tried to get the easy money shorting the stock and selling call options. This is an easy, instant-cash game to play that usually works... until it suddenly doesn't. These stocks are caught up in short squeezes and gamma squeezes. AMC has a short utilization rate around 99%, a cost to borrow of 10%, and a larger open interest position than actual shares. It's not crazy to try to get a piece of it (and the CEO/Board are particularly brilliant for capitalizing on this by selling shares to get cash for the company, bravo!). MVIS and GME aren't as tightly bound up, but they're hardly in normal parameters. BB isn't really in those squeezes yet, but it's a plausible target.\n\nI have no illusions that WSB is doing this themselves. Hop onto Fintel and see the ownership accumulation scores: AMC = 90, GME = 92, MVIS = 93. That's the feedback loop I mentioned, the hedge funds are in on the action, too. And it's part of why I'm here following this stuff.\n\nObviously, WSB is not a retirement plan, it's not a place to put all your savings, but it can be useful for allocating the portion of your portfolio dedicated to the high-risk, high-reward investments."], "2021-06-05 10": ["why not $NOK?", "Let\u2019s hope so!
