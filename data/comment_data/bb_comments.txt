Delivery times have already risen from 1 day to 1 month for PLCs, TI chips, sensors, and especially the drive technologies have been hit by a major shortage which is leading to, currently, 8 MONTHS delivery for frequency converters (usually 10 days). I have an order on my table for drive solutions (motor+FC) and the proposed delivery time for something that is usually in house in under a month is currently CW2 2022.\n\nThe reason for semiconductor shortages right now are manifold (mostly covid but also some tensions). I never comment on these things though because I can only see communication technologies from my job - which are hit by semiconductor and raw material shortages, the lead time for copper conductors went from 1 month to 5 months.\n\n\u20acdit btw don't trust analysts that say \"the shortage will cease soon\" - it's bollocks meant to appease investors, the shortage will continue for 2021 at least, even if supply ramps up to meet demand, orders are not being fulfilled right now that reach well into next year.", "No money is rotating out of GME at this point tbh.

Anyone???  The reason why AMC/BB held strong is because large floats are harder to push down/up. My point is retail has way too paper handed and impatient to hold through a sharp price dip that is inherent with smaller float stocks.

Looks better than the app I'm using. \n\n22 seems a bit of a high ended call. You always need to consider your break even share price, and your time range. At 22, your break even share cost due to the cost you paid for your contract is roughly in the 25.76 area. If you believe it will easily go up above that before then, then kudos. Sometimes, buying a lower dollar call, even though more expensive can be a safer bet for profit, and also a hedge against losses. If you buy close to current stock price, even if it does not go up much, it still won't expire worthless, and if it goes down, you have the ability to sell it before it expires worthless and minimize some of your losses. \n\nThe cost ratio of the contract will slowly go down over the course of time on the contract, even if share price goes up. In example: the cost of the contract at 18 dollars in the morning, will be a better sell price than the cost of the contract at 18 dollars by the end of the day. Even though the share price is the same. This must also be considered. If you intend on a long contract, best to go ones that are months long. Weeklies are better for snap profit and best if purchased on the Friday just before close due to power hours. \n\nIt's difficult to predict what is going to happen 2 weeks out, but it's hard to imagine stock in a good company only going down over the course of say 5 or 6 months, even with bad news. \n\nThat's why I always see people posting either weeklies, or months long contracts, one or the other.

Buy calls = bullish. Sell naked calls = bearish. Sell covered calls = bearish to certain extent, bullish to certain extent. \n\nSell puts = bullish, buy puts = bearish. \n\nWhen you sell naked calls/puts, you do not want to be assigned. You want to continuously sell them to collect the premium. \n\nWhen you sell COVERED calls, the idea can be mixed. You might want to sell because you hope to get assigned, thus you get strike + premium instead of just the sell revenue. This is bullish. But you also do not want the price to moon too extreme, because then you hand over shares at discount price. (If BB is 20, you sell a $25 contract for $5, you get $10 return when it hits 25 as opposed to just 5. If BB hits 100, you get $10 return, but not a penny more). However, you also do not want the stock to continuously move sideways, because the volatility will drop and you baghold for some time. \n\nSelling cash-secured puts is like saying \"I am betting the stock will not drop this far!\" However, this could really backfire. If BB is $20, and you sell $15 put for $7, you get $7. If BB is $30, you keep that $7. However, if BB drops to $2, you have to pay my shares for $15 regardless. You hold $2-worth share, at $15-7 = $8 price. \n\nSimilar to naked calls.

It's usually not the goal of call option buying to actually exercise the option and buy those shares at expiration. If you are bullish and think the stock will go up, then you would likely just buy the shares outright instead of the call option. Buying the call option is aimed at making a good return on less up front expense. Keep in mind, if the stock did go above $13 and you choose to exercise the option, you would have to put up $1300 right away, even if you wanted to turn around and sell those shares right back into the market. With stocks like Amazon, trading at like 3500, that's would mean you're on the hook for $350,000. So, obviously not ideal in a lot of cases.\n\nBut take this example: I buy one share of ABC company for $10. I also buy one call option of ABC for .10 (.10*100=$10), so the call and the stock are worth the same initially. Let's say the stock has been at $10 forever, and the call option had a far out expiration, like six months out, and a strike price of $25. Now, ABC goes up in value to 13.50 in a day (huge! 35% jump!) So my stock I bought for $10 has netted me $3.50 profit. The option however is priced differently based on the factors the other folks mentioned (I won't get into it). All of a sudden, because that stock suddenly surged, it looks way more likely that your call option might hit the strike price, so it's going to be worth more than you paid, probably by quite a bit. You still have a ton of time till expiration, and all of a sudden the stock is making big jumps, so your $10 option could very well be worth double or triple in that one day.\n\n\nThis happened with BB options (and others) in the last two days. I've been sitting on long dated 2023 $42 call options for months and they've been slowly losing value. But in the last two days, even though the stock price is still waaay below the strike price, they're now worth four times what I paid for them.", "That was true up to 1:30 this afternoon. $BB broke away from $AMC trendline right then.
