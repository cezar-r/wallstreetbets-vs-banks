SNDL seems like they want to be the 'fine wine' of the cannabis market while other companies are competing to drive down prices with less potent, but apparently much cheaper to produce products and strains.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's great and all that they want to make the most potent product possible but if an eighth of pretty-good-but-not-the-best weed costs $40 and an eighth of their product costs $50-$60 (just spitballing these numbers) they are assuming that consumers both care enough about the enhanced quality of their product to shell out for it (I think most people on average would just get the cheaper weed and simply smoke more) as well as trust their brand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would much rather they had come out and announced they were consolidating their product line to cut costs and streamline production.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion they should focus on maybe 3 high-end strains total: one Sativa, one Indica, and maybe one hybrid. When I care about getting the best bud I'm not going to be looking at a bunch of different strains to try something new, I'm going to stick to what I *know* is good. If I know that SNDL is the best product and I want a Sativa I am most likely going to arbitrarily pick a strain and then stick with it if it was as good as advertised. Someone else might arbitrarily pick a different strain and do the same thing. Now you have to stock a multitude of products in order to keep your customer base happy when most likely they both would have been happy with the same choice if they had just so happened to pick it first. Other than those they should also sell similar strains at a mid-grade level quality that would be able to compete in pricing with their competitors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen it comes to Vape Carts *that's* where you can open up your product line a bit more as from my experience people *love* trying different flavor carts from brands they trust. They wouldn't even need to grow additional strains they could just have their 'vanilla' strains in cart form and then run the flavor gamut from blueberry to fruity pebbles. That being said they are down significantly in sales from Q4 2020 in this sector so it might be better to just nix it altogether and focus on the only market sector in which they were *almost* able to compete with their Q4 numbers\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese 2 categories contributed roughly $11.5 mil in sales, Concentrates and Oils contributed about $680k. IMO it just doesn't make sense for an unprofitable company to be in these sectors. Not only are they seeing only a pittance in returns by way of sales, there is additional overhead associated with the processes of making the oils and concentrates. Literally spending more money to make less.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll that being said I actually am holding 200 shares for shits and giggles avg cost $0.75 because from a TA standpoint I thought that was a safe entry point.
