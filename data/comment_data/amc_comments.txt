If that's what you're referring to, then there's over 6 months before that even comes into play, if everything goes according to plan. And I'm honestly not sure how much the business fundamentals matter at this point. If there's a ton of unreported short interest, and if shareholders hold until the shorts have to cover, then the share prices are bound to go up. The only thing required is for a lot of shareholders (and/or well-financed shareholders) to know that there is enough short interest for the buyback to be worth the wait. And I feel like that's the situation we're in. Evidence like the recent price action and Jefferies restricting short selling signals that there is indeed a lot of unreported short interest. Besides, I think GameStop, at least, has some promising changes in the works for its business fundamentals. (I don't know much about Microvision.) You mention GameStop's price having gone down, but bear in mind that large amounts of short selling will drive the price down temporarily. And again, we have increasing evidence of a large number of short positions, yet GME is still around $250. If people are confident that a large forced buy-in is coming, why would they decide to sell en masse before that happens? Furthermore, why would long shareholders change course now, after several months of waiting patiently? What's changed? Not AMC's fundamentals, right? And their next stock sell-off is proposed for next year. And Jefferies' recent change should be encouraging for long shareholders, not discouraging.

When a news article comes out saying \"AMC says fuck retail traders and blows a hedge fund for a dime bag\", these people know that that sounds bad for them but don't know how to tell if it is or even what to do if it is actually bad. So they freak out.\n\n\nI will point out that this is not a US exclusive issue. Honestly, we are far from the worst.

Prove me wrong on this company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAllow me to summarize:\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nWorkhorse develops electric trucks.\r  \n\r  \nWe all know where the future is going with electric vehicles. The people want it, the government wants it, and a lot of private and public money is being poured in to make this happen. Legislation is aiming to make and force this to happen.\r  \n\r  \nThe government wants zero emissions. Workhorse trucks are already zero-emission. Gas and diesel-powered trucks are not. These companies are going to have a tough time catching up.\r  \n\r  \nWorkhorse has a proprietary system to help manage its fleet and increase its efficiency. This helps increase revenue.\r  \n\r  \nCathie Wood of Ark Investment Management, who has been very popular lately (google her), has purchased a few million shares for her fund\r  \n\r  \nIn April, Workhorse more than doubled its production of trucks in comparison to the combined previous three quarters. The Pride Group placed an order for 6230 trucks. That's 6230!!! That's an enormous amount of trucks. They couldn't produce this because of global limitations. There is a bottleneck within the global supply chain in part due to offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components. This has affected the entire industry, including Ford and GM. This is only TEMPORARY and will get worked out as it always does because every company wants to sell and make money.\r  \n\r  \nSales for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately $521,000 compared to approximately $84,000 in the first quarter of 2020. That is a significant increase.\r  \n\r  \nThe Company had approximately $205.1 million in cash in March 2021. This helps limit the need to acquire debt.\r  \n\r  \nThe stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a $6 billion contract with the USPS. This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company. This one-time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean Workhorse will lose out on other contracts from the USPS or other companies.\r  \n\r  \n350,00 delivery trucks are sold per year according to the New York Times. This number will most likely increase.\r  \n\r  \nCalls with a strike price of $15 for Jun 18, 2021 had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options. This may mean investors may be expecting a big move.\r  \n\r  \nYou're helping the environment by investing in this company.\r  \n\r  \nMOST IMPORTANTLY, this stock has about a 40% short of its float. You want to give it to the hedge funds and the short sellers? You want to get in early on a short squeeze? This is the opportunity to make it happen. AMC was shorted about 20% on its float and look what it did. WKHS is shorted about doubled that!!!\r  \n\r  \nTLDR\r  \n\r  \nWorkhorse (WKHS) is a highly-shorted (nearly 40%) stock with the potential for a very lucrative future. It is still priced pretty low. There is tremendous potential for gains here. Someone please try and prove me wrong. I beg you to try and prove me wrong.\r  \n\r  \nPlease note, I am not a financial analyst.

Looks like an excuse to sell shares and with that snake of a ceo i wouldnt be surprised if it had been done to favor a friend at the hf in exchange of a few mills.\n\nThe boom will be very short. Remember why people dont go as much as they used to.\n\nWhen i was younger (in bulgaria), there was no streaming , piracy wasent that much of a thing, big screens werent affordable, so very few people had them. Which left you with only one option if you wanted to go to a new movie, which were theaters.\n\nI went from going at least every month to maybe twice a year, sometimes not a single time a year. I still like movies. But now, i can wait a few weeks to watch it on my projector, eat whatever i want at a decent price, which makes it a very solid option for the price. Now theaters , nowadays ... overpriced food, always some mfkers on their phones, kids crying... i dont know the lost its lust as other options became available.\n\nAnd yes, there will be a boom in the industry post covid, like many, but it aint \u00e0 substainable boost in the long run. \n\nRemember that theaters is a luxury expense. What you think will hapen when inflation hits the fan and people will get less out of their money? Where do you cut in the expenses when you start to be short on money? In the luxury expenses.

There\u2019s always more money out there. Sounds silly but, we all live in the gme/amc world, and should know by now there\u2019s more money out there... more that we can imagine. \n\nOver not a great picture. What can you do? I\u2019d try my best to get a down payment anyway I can. Be it crazy saving, borrowing from someone, yolo\u2019ing on amc next week. Finding someone to get you a mortgage (ask around, someone will be able to help you; check with agents that seem to turn over a lot of business if you can\u2019t find one yourself). Then pick an area you can afford, you might need to further and further out. But stay smart, and check that your area isn\u2019t appreciating more than close by areas (don\u2019t buy the worst value...even if it\u2019s all expensive) .\n\nThe Bull housing market is not going anywhere as long as interest rates and stimulus stay around and it looks like years of it still. \n\nTo the moon (where all the gen z will be renting...)", "Join us in the AMC gain train!", "AMC to moon ooga", "No AMC or GME on this thread please", "No amc?

So for example let's say you sold a call at a strike price of $25. Let's also pretend that AMC is trading above $25, so whoever you sold that call to is going to exercise it. So they exercise their call at $25, which then auto-exercises your LEAPS at $12 per share, and then gives you the strike width, or the difference between the strikes. So in this specific case you'd be left with $1300 (the difference between what you paid to exercise the LEAPS versus what you got paid for the shares) plus whatever premium you got paid to sell that covered call.\n\n\nOR another scenario is AMC never hits $25 and the call you sold expires worthless, so you get to just keep the premium you sold the covered call for, PLUS you get to keep your LEAPS so you can just write more covered calls again and receive more premium. Theoretically, if you did this enough, and received enough premium, you could bring your cost basis low enough for that LEAPS that it's almost free. And at that point you'll just be playing with house money.\n\n\nOf course there IS a downside to this strategy, which is: if you sell a call at $25 and amc goes to $35 the same day, you're gonna lose out on the gains from $25 to $35. Whatever you sell your call at will cap your gains (or at least theoretically \"cost you money\", you could still roll your covered call out and up but that's another lesson for another time), so if your underlying randomly moons and you have a covered call out you can miss part of those gains. \n\n\nIf you're more interested in this strategy and want to learn more, using a LEAPS as collateral for writing covered calls is called a \"poor man's covered call\".

Let\u2019s begin!\n\nHedge Funds, governments, financial security, has been founded on monetary gains.  The federal reserve was/is a debt based system, and over the last 100 years, we let our financial ecosystem run its course.  Where does this leave us?  With an imbalance unlike any other and the perfect storm to right 100 years of wrong. \n\nIt really is amazing, I\u2019m an IT Director, and technology never ceases to amaze me. Out technological revolution on the scale of existence is like we invented fire a million times over in a week\u2019s time.  We have come together to be the collective power, mind, soul, being true to our instinct of a pack. Reddit proved this, that\u2019s why THIS, this future, this coming battle against the power and wealth, is the first example of how we can unite.  How we ARE smarter together!\n\nThat\u2019s great and we will win and burn these fuckers funds, but wait... that\u2019s the immediate future, what about the aftermath?  The loss of their wealth, which they hoarded, don\u2019t get me wrong, but they also gave a measly percentage to our economy/retirement/false financial freedom.  So we take them down, and bet I\u2019m taking them down regardless, but that ripple effect will trigger a normal that the rest of the world will feel. \n\nThis is MORE than their demise, it\u2019s a true revolution.  I seriously thought, and don\u2019t tell me when riots were all about after months of a lockdown, you didn\u2019t think there was going to a civil war, that COVID would have pushed to a reform.  But it didn\u2019t.  But, odds are, this WILL!\n\nFood for thought:  What if the government bails them out, fucks our funds and it\u2019s back to square one.  They\u2019ve done it before.   Pay billions in bonuses and give them more billions, all while our cities suffer. Our health suffers.  Our wealth suffers...  would you let them fuck you again, and again, and again...  what about again?  When do you actually fuck them?? When you get $1 million a share (REMEMBER: I\u2019m holding till HF\u2019s tank, every ape is a millionaire, and justice has been restored), but these fuckers are the ones in power, making decisions.   All this we have done, are doing, and are willing to die for... it\u2019s obvious for me we are changing the world, but be prepared for the smoke and mirrors to fall. (In which case, a revolt will form)\n\nWhat\u2019s that mean?  Let\u2019s not get greedy with wealth for Lambos, Rolexes, million dollar yachts with your wife\u2019s boyfriend as the butler,  but instead KEEP our camaraderie!  Keep looking out for each other. We have the technology to be smarter as a whole. Stop letting ancient, pre-tech, beliefs rule us. We are better, smarter, stronger because we can ALL come together and we are living proof of this!! \n \nHas anyone thought about the aftermath?  Just saying...  We NEED each other, now, later, and forever.  My point is, post- squeeze, let\u2019s all keep our composure and remember where we came from and why we are doing this.

AMC couldn't generate enough cash from its business before the pandemic to service its existing debt, so how is it going to do so now, while also reducing its debt load?\r\n* A significant portion of AMC's debt -- especially that due in 2026 -- is non-convertible. This is a fancy way of saying that the company will be required to repay debtholders with cash, not common stock. There's virtually no chance the company will have the capital needed to pay off its debt, and no bank in their right mind is going to lend to AMC without a double-digit interest rate, if at all.\r\n* The company had a free cash outflow of $324.8 million just in the first three months of 2021.

Well... if you don't study charts much I would encourage you to start now and look at AMC's one month chart on Yahoo and please compare the current price, 10 day, and 50 day moving averages and make sure you use one day intervals. What you will see is when AMC closed today at $10.32 the price had just broken over the 50 day moving average and people that's on a one month chart. Now look back on the chart a few days to the last time you see the current price breaking over the 50 day moving average. To save you time the and effort the last time this happened was on April 4th and the price was at $9.11. After that occurred, the price shot up to 11.50 within the next 2 weeks. That's nearly a $2.50 move and I expect to see a similar occurrence but at even a a faster pace with volume picking up like it has been lately. The best part is, the higher the price steadily climbs, (look at AMC's 5 day chart) the more confidence retailers will have and when you couple that with the number of people buying and holding with so much upside potential we could see a move of over $3.00 to the upside from this price and now in the after hours the price is at $10.40 so we're breaking even higher over the 50 day as I type. I won't even talk about the possibility of a mega-squeeze which I for one am not relying on. Lastly, AMC is practically the only stock in my portfolio that saw an increase today and that's one heck of a lot to be said with the DOW down almost 700 points.
