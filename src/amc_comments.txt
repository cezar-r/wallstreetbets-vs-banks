But there can be a place for WSB in a reasonable portfolio, because WSB is a data point for retail investor sentiment, and because there's now a feedback loop between WSB and hedge funds. Around 5% of my portfolio is informed, in part, by WSB. \n\nFor example, at the moment some of the WSB stonks are AMC, BB, MVIS, GME, CLNE, and NOK.\n\nNOK is the funniest one: it's a genuinely undervalued stock. Use any metric you like (P/E, EV/EBITDA, FCF Yield, ROIC/WACC) and the company is trading at a bargain. There are a lot of good reasons to believe Wall Street's analysts are behind the ball on this one. Pretty normal type of trade, TBH, and if it's got momentum, awesome.\n\nCLNE is the opposite: bad numbers IMHO, but the few Wall Street analysts covering it think it should trade for double its value. It's a bet the market will catch up to where it's publicly forecast to be. Also a normal type of trade. \n\nAMC, GME, and MVIS are more classically WSB stocks: absolute garbage fires, companies that were such obvious losers with no hope of a future that a lot of Wall Street banks and hedge funds got lazy and careless and tried to get the easy money shorting the stock and selling call options. This is an easy, instant-cash game to play that usually works... until it suddenly doesn't. These stocks are caught up in short squeezes and gamma squeezes. AMC has a short utilization rate around 99%, a cost to borrow of 10%, and a larger open interest position than actual shares. It's not crazy to try to get a piece of it (and the CEO/Board are particularly brilliant for capitalizing on this by selling shares to get cash for the company, bravo!). MVIS and GME aren't as tightly bound up, but they're hardly in normal parameters. BB isn't really in those squeezes yet, but it's a plausible target.\n\nI have no illusions that WSB is doing this themselves. Hop onto Fintel and see the ownership accumulation scores: AMC = 90, GME = 92, MVIS = 93. That's the feedback loop I mentioned, the hedge funds are in on the action, too.

CNK EV is currently at $6.13b.  Given that AMC is the largest publicly traded in the sector, with double the amount of theatres worldwide of CNK, let's just say AMC EV should be double CNK (fundamentals, right?).  So if the EV SHOULD be $12.26b, the reverse math would be $12.23b EV - $800m cash + $1.1b debt= $12.53b market cap.  That is 6X the $2b amount above, meaning the actual share price SHOULD be 6X $5= $30 / share. \n\nIs this also more retarded ape math?

Its something i use on huge spikes.  High IV = Sell calls as option premium is excellent. On dips I will buy the calls to go long. Those are the big monymakers with AMC currently.

Anyone???  The reason why AMC/BB held strong is because large floats are harder to push down/up. My point is retail has way too paper handed and impatient to hold through a sharp price dip that is inherent with smaller float stocks.

All we can do when we are trained in finance is use our best judgment based on historical examples to give an educated guess at what those variable values may be. In my first example I used what happened historically to show how AMC may react to a squeeze based on how another company's stocks did (GME). Several people pointed out however that the markets were flawed in that squeeze due to throttled upside by large financial institutions to slow thier losses. Whether that was intentional or not, i do believe it did in fact happen to slow the rise of GME. VW on the other hand was able to skyrocket in 2008 with no resistance so it only seemed fair to use those variables to calculate the rise for AMC. What I can say is that there are still variables Un accounted for. The most important probably being the %of short float. Another is the overall size different of the market as a whole from 2008 until now. I will humbly say that basically if the math proves to be wrong it is simply because there is no equation that I am capable of putting together that wouldn't take a professor of calculus to solve.

Y'all need to load up on TELL and TEN.", "amc is never coming back down is it", "Bill Ackman is a hedge fund manager. He runs Pershing Square Capital Management. Accredited investors and institutions give him money to invest on their behalf. Separately, he also runs Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, a SPAC. Investors gave him about $20 per share to invest in a company. If he can't find a company, he'll give the investors back their $20/share. If he can find one, he'll buy the company. Whenever there is short term hype about him buying a company, the price of the SPAC shares rise. Currently, you would pay $25 for $20 of cash and presumably $5 worth of Ackman's investing prowess. But there are times where it's been worth $31, which is a pretty big premium for Ackman. The logic is that if Ackman does buy a good company, the company he takes public might be worth a lot more very quickly. It's basically a mystery box.\n\nIn this case, Mudrick is a hedge fund manager. His hedge fund made a ton of money by buying then flipping AMC. Separately, his SPAC is worth less money on the open market. But the cash value held in the SPAC is unchanged. It's just that if you own shares in the SPAC, you can't sell them for as much because there is short term sentiment against Mudrick. But that's irrelevant to Mudrick himself because as the SPAC sponsor, he can't sell his shares right now anyways.\n\nThe real money Mudrick lost here is the potential gains he would have had by holding AMC a big longer. If the stock crashes tomorrow, he made a good bet by selling. If it doubles, he missed out on a huge profit by scalping a small profit. During the first squeeze, AMC itself sold a ton of shares for about $4-5, Silver Lake sold a bunch of shares for like $7-11. Mudrick immediately flipped his shares. All of them seem to think the stock is massively overvalued, but the price has kept rising despite that. That's what makes these meme stocks. Their prices are completely divorced from the fundamental values of the companies. Everyone knows this, but the prices keep going up. Short squeezing, hype, mania, etc. are all the terms used to describe this situation. Eventually it will crash. But no one knows when. If you miss the upswing, you miss huge gains. If you are caught on the downswing, you can lose every penny you have.\n\nI'm not sure about Mudrick, but I don't blame him for selling. The same goes for AMC and Silver Lake. This isn't really in Mudrick's wheelhouse of distressed asset investing. It's an opportunity for traders. People should invest in what they know and understand. If you are a healthcare investor, and a stock you owns leaves the healthcare space and enters the technology space, it makes sense to sell the stock even if it might make more money in the future simply because you don't have a competitive advantage anymore.", "Because that's the most logical explanation right?

Consoles are in high demand with lower price points on digital consoles. Consoles that render the purchase of physical games useless. Retail requires high overhead costs especially with labor and logistics. Not to mention we now live in a society where being a hermit and instant gratification is the norm (in this country anyway), at least within certain demographics. Unless they change their game (fun with pun) GME is bleeding out bad.\n\nAMC - Also a high overhead company with a need for physical locations and labor forces. They are playing in a market with growing digital dominance. Over the past year new movie releases are playing at home rather than a theater near you. Although there is a still a high desire to get out and do things in certain demographics the battle for AMC will be extremely challenging.\n\nDigital &gt; Physical - Digital offers much higher profit margins in today's connected world. Overhead costs are extremely low. Why would you, as a company, choose to spend millions on labor, logistics, production, manufacturing when you can sell the same product at the same price points with a far greater profit margin?

Every move outside of this list is either ineffective or just not profitable. These options are listed from lowest risk -&gt; highest risk\n\n1) Sell your long calls and your shares and realize your gains. You YOLO'd a shit ton of money and lived to tell the tale, spend some of the gains on yourself to celly and move on to the next play. Recommend keeping $10K for long calls/long puts, $20K in holding VTI or some standard index ETF, the rest in individual shares\n\n2) Sell your long calls and write covered calls on your shares. Contrary to what you would believe from this subreddit, getting a 3x or higher on long calls is rare, and at any time, especially in a highly volatile stock like AMC, you can forfeit all your gains on them with one bad trading day. With writing 15-20% OTM calls, you not only cash in on high IV and collect a nice $10K paycheck, but also leave the potential to profit an extra 15-20% on your shares while only having the obligation to hold them for another 1-3 weeks\n\n3) Hold your long calls and shares, but set a stop loss. With this option you're not capping your potential upside and also you get to sleep with the peace of mind that no matter what, you still come out ahead on this YOLO. The worst case scenario here is that AMC gaps down before the next trading day, triggering your stop loss below the limit you set it at\n\n4) Hold your long calls and shares, no stop loss. You are comfortable putting $80K+ on a roulette table with no insurance. Best of luck here\n\n\nWith keeping the long calls and writing covered calls, I'm not sure if that option is available for my brokerage personally to have both of those positions at the same time, but I'd say it's option 2.5 here. Kind of a half assed strategy that doesn't negate the risk of the long calls while capping your potential upside on the shares", "Rally on that AMC today!
